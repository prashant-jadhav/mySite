### As you had asked beta

Hi Megha,

Some times back, you had asked why you are not having your own website, on which I had asked you another question, "What exactly you want to do with your own site?"

To my surprise, you mentioned that you want to write stories. Well, good or bad, big or small, that doesn't matter until you actually keep writing... whether stories, poems, random thoughts...

As *Carlos Fuentes* had said

<blockquote>Writing is a struggle against silence.</blockquote>

So it better to be expressed than staying silent...

Here is your platform. Go ahead... express yourself...

From,
Your beloved Pappa
